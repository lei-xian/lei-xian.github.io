I am a software engineer live in Seattle now and want to travel around the world, learn different civilizations through my own experience. I enjoy exploring new place and new cuisine and create some dish to present my understanding of food and my cultural. 

Growup in China and moved to U.S. in 2017 for my graduate study. Spent 3 years in University of Georgia, the friends, professors, beautiful campus made my memory. Even now, the colorful fall Athens is still in my mind and the breeze is still ring in my ear.
