Hello, I am Lei Xian. Welcome to my homepage! I would like to share some interesting and boring things about me in this website, such as my study, my travel... 

I got my belochor degree at Beijing Forestry University major in Electronic Commerce. After that, I continued my graduate study at University of Georgia, M.S. in Computer Science and Applied Economics. I obtained M.S. degree in Computer Science at Dec. 2019. Hopefully, I wish i could graduate the M.S. in Applied Economics in May.2020. Currently, I am waiting for my EAD card to start my first job at Nordstrom(super excited and connot wait)! 

I like traveling, programming, eating yummy food around the world, also I like staying with my family. Hope I can keep writing this blog, maybe it will be my precious memory in the future.
